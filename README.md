Function: Automatically colors black & white images 

Personal Project. Web development using Python (Flask). Modify the algorithm for website integration. Deployment on AWS cloud.

Based off of a pre-trained image colorization [algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) made by Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros.

### Instructions

- Go to the website: 
- Upload a black and white image (hint: landscapes and portraits work the best)
- Press 'Submit' and wait for the algorithm to finish its job (bigger images take longer)
- That's it!
